Restaurant Food Reservation System
The Restaurant Food Reservation System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the process of reserving seats and ordering food in restaurants. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js, offering a modern and efficient solution for restaurant management and customer service.

**Key Features:**

1. **Seat Reservation:** Customers can easily browse available seats based on date, time, and party size, and reserve seats for their desired dining experience.

2. **Menu Exploration:** The system provides an interactive menu where customers can explore the restaurant's offerings, view dishes, prices, and descriptions, and make informed decisions about their orders.

3. **Online Ordering:** Customers have the convenience of placing their food orders online, either in advance while making a reservation or during their dining experience, reducing wait times and minimizing errors.

4. **Real-time Updates:** The system offers real-time updates on seat availability, reservation status, and order processing, allowing restaurant staff to manage operations efficiently and provide timely service to customers.

5. **Customer Management:** A comprehensive customer management system stores customer information, preferences, and order history, enabling personalized service and tailored recommendations.

6. **Administration Dashboard:** Restaurant managers have access to a centralized dashboard where they can manage reservations, update menus, track orders, and analyze performance metrics, empowering data-driven decision-making and operational optimization.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Node.js:** A powerful server-side JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and high-performance web applications.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution that stores data in JSON-like documents, providing high availability and horizontal scalability.
